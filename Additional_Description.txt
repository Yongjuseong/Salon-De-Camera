<System logic comment>
If you start this application in the Android environment and choose your photo, 
the application will send your photo to the server, and then the server detects your face in the photo using OpenCV and make a photo file in /Server/backs/ as Faces.png.
After a computer vision deep learning model with Faces.png, the result will be stored as a file in /Server/backs/ as crop_hair.png.
Lastly, the application offers a high quality of service to users, using crop_hair.png with AR functions.
